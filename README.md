# Dino

Dino is a brand new package manager for Node.js, written in Rust. It aims to be a drop-in replacement for npm that's faster and safer.

## Current commands

### `init`

`dino init` intelligently uses your working environment and Git config to create a `package.json` with sane defaults.

In the above image, the `repository` was automatically picked up on by Dino! (So was the default `name`, but it was changed manually)

### `run`

`dino run` runs scripts in your `package.json` file!

If no arguments are provided, it instead lists the scripts in the `package.json` file.
